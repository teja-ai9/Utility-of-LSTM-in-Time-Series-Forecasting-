# Utility-of-LSTM-in-Time-Series-Forecasting-
LSTMs can be used to model univariate time series forecasting problems. These are problems comprised of a single series of observations and a model is required to learn from the series of past observations to predict the next value in the sequence. Here, we shall see if LSTM can be a good predictor of inflation levels of India. Inflation measured by consumer price index (CPI) is defined as the change in the prices of a basket of goods and services that are typically purchased by specific groups of households. Inflation is measured in terms of the annual growth rate and in index, 2015 base year with a breakdown for food, energy and total excluding food and energy.
